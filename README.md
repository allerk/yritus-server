# What and why?

This is a backend server for my personal project called "Yritus" from estonian word "Ã¼ritus".
I'm looking forward to create a website where people can find fresh information about the different upcoming events in Tallinn.
I believe that this website can help people to find a relevant event by bringing together all the info from different social medias where this info typically posted.
E.g. russian speaking people in Estonia usually prefer Telegram while estonians uses Facebook. In this project I'm aiming to provide
the full picture of upcoming events in one place to exclude searching it on a different platforms.

## It's still in development...

So nothing more special here... :)
